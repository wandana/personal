Word embedding computation using co-occurence matrix option. The resulting word vectors are then reduced using
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), a type of PCA to form a word embedding in a lower dimension.
Training is done using the Reuters corpus with 10,788 news documents totaling 1.3 million words.
